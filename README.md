# Rainfall-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Project Overview

Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning is a project that utilizes historical weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and previous rainfall to train machine learning models. The main objective is to accurately predict future rainfall amounts using regression techniques, supporting applications in agriculture, water resource planning, and disaster preparedness.

Key Project Components

Data Collection & Preprocessing

Gather real weather data

Clean missing values and handle outliers

Select relevant features for modeling

 Feature Engineering

Identify the most influential features (e.g., humidity may correlate more with rainfall than temperature) to improve model accuracy

 Model Training & Evaluation

Implement regression models (e.g., Linear Regression)

Evaluate performance using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

RÂ² Score

 Outcome and Applications

Hydrological planning

Crop irrigation management

Flood or drought preparedness

 Why This Project Stands Out

Unique & Relevant: Applies ML to environmental science, making it both novel and impactful

Interviewâ€‘Friendly: Clear workflow from data collection to model evaluation

Scalable: Easy to extend with:

Hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search)

Advanced models (e.g., XGBoost)

Deployment using Streamlit or Flask
